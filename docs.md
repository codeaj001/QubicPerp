About Qubic
Qubic is a high-performance blockchain built for speed, scalability, and real-world integrations.
Its unique computational model allows developers to run decentralized applications and smart contracts with deterministic execution and efficient consensus - bringing scalable computation to Web3.

By joining this hackathon, you’ll gain hands-on experience with Qubic’s technology and become part of the early community of builders shaping its growing ecosystem.

Participants will work directly with the Qubic Network, the Nostromo Launchpad, and EasyConnect, its no-code integration layer.



Design and launch innovative applications that bring real utility, liquidity, and user engagement to the Qubic Network.


You’ll build projects that expand Qubic’s capabilities and demonstrate the power of its computational and transactional infrastructure.


Choose your path below:





💥 Track 1 – Nostromo Launchpad

Develop and launch high-impact protocols that will define the future of the Qubic Network.

Nostromo is the official launchpad built on Qubic, designed to help teams move from concept → deployment → community launch.



💡What to build


• DeFi & Finance: Lending, DEXs, yield optimizers, derivatives, perpetuals, oracles

• Payments & RWAs: Tokenized assets, crypto cards, payment rails

• Infrastructure & Middleware: Developer tooling, automation frameworks

• Experimental Apps: Anything that pushes Qubic’s computational model further



⚡ Track 2 – EasyConnect Integrations
EasyConnect extends Qubic to the no-code world.
Created by Kairos (winners of previous Qubic hackathons), it connects Qubic’s blockchain events with Make, Zapier, and n8n, letting anyone automate workflows or build dApps without writing code.



💡What to build 

• Automate airdrops based on token purchases in QX

• Create gamified community systems (Discord, Telegram, X)

• Build real-time token dashboards and analytics

• Develop market trend monitors or signal bots

• Trigger alerts for whale wallet movements

• Integrate EasyConnect features into Nostromo projects for analytics, notifications or gamification

Technologies & Workshops




Participants will work directly with the technologies powering the Qubic ecosystem.
Each track gives you access to the tools and technologies you need to bring your ideas to life—whether through Qubic’s blockchain infrastructure or no-code integrations via EasyConnect.



🚀 Qubic & Nostromo Launchpad

Qubic provides the underlying blockchain infrastructure for all projects built in its ecosystem, while Nostromo serves as the official launchpad that helps teams move from concept to ecosystem-ready projects.

During the hackathon, teams in the Nostromo track can validate ideas, shape their protocol designs, and prepare their projects for potential launch pathways within the Qubic ecosystem. Developers may optionally explore the Qubic Testnet if their project requires smart-contract components, but technical deployment is not required for all participants.

Nostromo’s goal is to support promising builders by offering early-stage visibility, ecosystem alignment, and a clear route for projects ready to grow within Qubic.

⚙️ EasyConnect
EasyConnect empowers anyone, even those with no coding background, to connect Qubic’s blockchain events with automation tools like Make, Zapier, and n8n.



Teams in this track can build dashboards, automations, analytics tools, gamified community systems, or workflow engines that respond to Qubic token activity and contract events. EasyConnect accounts and templates will be provided during onboarding, and no smart-contract deployment is required.



EasyConnect makes blockchain data usable within the broader digital ecosystem, allowing real-time automations and integrations without writing a single line of code.
